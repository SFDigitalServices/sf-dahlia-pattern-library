notes: |
   Newer assistive software will also immediately interpret any table with the attribute `role=grid` as being for data. 

   Always use `th` to define the headers for columns and rows. If a header cell is not a `th`, but a `td`, use the `scope` attribute to explain what kind of heading the cell is: `scope=row` means the cell is a header for the row it's inside. `scope=column` means the cell is a header for the column it's inside.

      <th scope="col">Rent</th>
